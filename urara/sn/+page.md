It's so imperative to discern the signal over noise. You need to continually ask yourself, "what is the most important thing" for a particular system or something you're doing or anything. You need to cut away the noise and focus on the most significant parts. For example, asking "what are the limitations in a machine learning model" is such a great way to gauge the places where we can improve. It's super great to of course be excited by something and come up with new ideas and become a visionary. But you need to remain close to the truth to make advancements.
